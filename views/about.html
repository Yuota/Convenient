                        <br> When you when you're hungry, a sumptuous feast that is happiness; when you're suffering from diseases afflict and torment, when having a healthy body is happy; when you cry when a kind words of comfort that is happiness; when you're running for a long time in the din of the crowd having a peace of mind is happiness itself. When you get tired after a heavy meal, you'll find the occasional bread is a kind of happiness ... ...
                        <br> Located about happiness has no fixed standard, it is as if a threshold, it is high or low depends entirely on your own. When you yourself can't feel happy with what, and perhaps in the eyes of others is a kind of happiness. Happy people in a different environment, the feeling of happiness is not the same, but have one thing in common, it is spiritual happiness will produce happiness. Therefore, in daily life, we might as well listen to the voice came from inside, so long as the heart is full of happiness life abound everywhere.
                        <br> Happiness is a feeling that invisible, untouchable, it precipitates in everyone's hearts. In life, you may not have a lot of material and fame, as long as you have a good mood, then you are happy. When you adopt an optimistic attitude towards life, and happiness will be the same as your shadow appears beside you.
